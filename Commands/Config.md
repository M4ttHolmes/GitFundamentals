# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work wiht the git config commands in order to set up your identity. 

For example, your identity can be set up with commands such as:

```
git config --global user.name "Matt Holmes"
git config --global user.email m4ttholmes#gmail.com
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
